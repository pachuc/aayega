Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality has made a splash in the consumer market, but its potential still remains untapped at a commercial level. These innovative technologies have huge potential for revolutionizing business processes. 

Training employees. AR can provide employees contextual information on the job, to better enable them to make decisions quickly. VR can simulate rare or even dangerous scenarios so employees can learn how to safely deal with all possibilities. AR & VR integrations can also provide important feedback for the company to understand challenges the employees face, and what aspects of the work can be optimized.

Remote operations. Using VR, businesses can control anything from vehicles, construction equipment, or even robots remotely. Running a service using remote operation can provide a lot of value, while also serving as the perfect stepping stone towards full automation. VR based control can also provide tons of data, and a tight feedback loop for developing automation and more intelligent systems.
